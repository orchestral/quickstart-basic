## Introduction

This quickstart guide provides a basic introduction to the Orchestra Platform and includes content on database migrations, the Eloquent ORM, routing, validation, views, and Blade templates. This is a great starting point if you are brand new to the Orchestra Platform, Laravel framework or PHP frameworks in general. If you have already used Laravel or other PHP frameworks, you may wish to consult one of our more advanced quickstarts.

To sample a basic selection of Laravel features, we will build a simple task list we can use to track all of the tasks we want to accomplish (the typical "to-do list" example). The complete, finished source code for this project is [available on GitHub](http://github.com/orchestral/quickstart-basic).
